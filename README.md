# A-B-Testing-Project

For this project, I worked on understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Some descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the data set in order to drive conclusions from the data set. In the end, a liner regression model was built in order to help understand what drives conversions.
